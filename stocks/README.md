This branch contains a version of the Spring AMQP stocks sample modified to take advantage of Spring MVC 3.2, Servlet-based async support. The change shows how an existing application with client-side polling can improve its latency while also optimizing the number of requests required to deliver updates. 

The details of the changes can be viewed in the following [commit](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-amqp-samples/commit/1a241f8cd68835fa9e6af4e987bccf7b9e6b8bf1).
